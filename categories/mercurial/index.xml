From adding wrong files to pushing bad commits, I have done it all. So, as the end of my internship is nearing, I&amp;rsquo;m making a list of fixes that I learned during this journey.
Adding all files Most of us have a muscle memory of doing this:
git/hg add . git/hg commit -m &amp;#34;foo&amp;#34; git/hg push But if you are working on a legacy codebase which is as old as time itself, you will have to look twice for a ignore file before adding everything.</description></item></channel></rss>
