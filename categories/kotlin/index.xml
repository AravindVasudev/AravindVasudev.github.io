With all the new languages out there, Java&amp;rsquo;s verbose nature and lack of syntactic sugar is not the most pleasing language to code in. Even though language alternatives like Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin exist for Android, I stuck with hybrid app development due to the lack of proper documentation for these alternatives.
A couple of days back, the Android team announced first-class support for kotlin and I started seeing a lot of Kotlin praise and tutorial coming up across the internet community.</description></item></channel></rss>
