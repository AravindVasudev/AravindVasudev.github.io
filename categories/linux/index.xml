Since I own only one laptop, I do not prefer distro jumping and needed to settle down with something. After googling for a while, I picked Ubuntu.
Ubuntu, with some fixes and theming, is a really awesome distro to dive into. Except for the WiFi issue, which is partially fixable, everything seemed nice about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
