completely move to GNU/Linux (Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s not Linux, it&amp;rsquo;s GNU/Linux).
Since I own only one laptop, I do not prefer distro jumping and needed to
settle down with something. After googling for a while, I picked Ubuntu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/images/blog/close_windows.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ubuntu, with some fixes and theming, is a really awesome distro to dive into.
Except for the WiFi issue, which is partially fixable, everything seemed nice
about it. But, being a developer, I tend to stick with latest releases of my
development tools and Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s release cycle wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing it for me. I tried
using PPAs but after a while, I started adding more and more PPAs that I started
losing count of. I heard a lot about Arch Linux&amp;rsquo;s rolling release but was
too afraid to break my only computer. After getting suggestions from a friend,
I decided to finally move to Arch Linux. I was too lazy to install it from scratch so
chose Antergos instead, which provides an awesome UI for installation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
