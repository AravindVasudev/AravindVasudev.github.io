Preparing for coding interviews definitely gets our nerves rattling, even if weâ€™ve been coding for years. No matter how seasoned you are, the pressure of interviews can still be overwhelming.
Before my Google interview, a friend pointed me to the blog Get that job at Google. The author introduces the concept of the &amp;ldquo;Interview Anti-Loop&amp;rdquo; which really stuck with me.</description></item><item><title>Recursion, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming</title><link>/2024/recursion-graphs-and-dp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2024/recursion-graphs-and-dp/</guid><description>This write-up aims to connect graph theory with solving dynamic programming problems. Instead of delving into the basics of these concepts, we will focus on building an intuition for using these concepts. We will start by exploring the idea behind recursion, followed by graphs, and finally wrap up with top-down dynamic programming.
Recursion Recursion is defining a problem in terms of itself.
What does this even mean? We all would have seen the classic example of generating the Nth fibonacci sequence using recursion:</description></item><item><title>Pinning Git Submodule To A Revision</title><link>/2023/pinning-git-submodule-to-a-revision/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2023/pinning-git-submodule-to-a-revision/</guid><description>This blog requires some understanding of git plumbing commands and the basics of submodules. The resources below are a good start.
Git Tools - Submodules Git Internals The submodules chapter within the git book is pretty extensive on how to use git submodules. However, it misses covering some real-world details.
Recently, I was working on pinning my submodule to a specific revision and rolling that revision using a script. At first, this seems pretty straightforward from the documentation.</description></item><item><title>Solving Wordle</title><link>/2022/solving-wordle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2022/solving-wordle/</guid><description>I started writing this article around January 2022 but never got around publishing it. Given its September already, I&amp;rsquo;m going ahead and publishing the draft. This is not intended to be read/shared but to just keep this blog going.
I have been playing wordle continously for the past week with my colleagues. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple game where you guess a five letter word within six chances. At each guess, the game tells you how many letters you got right, how many letters are in the word in a different position, and how many aren&amp;rsquo;t present in the answer.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrapping your vimrc</title><link>/2018/bootstrapping-your-vimrc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2018/bootstrapping-your-vimrc/</guid><description>When I first started with vim, I had trouble understanding how vim configuration worked and it was hard for me to use the plain vim. So I had to copy the .vimrc of a friend and as time moved, I kept adding over it to a point where my vim started slowing down. So, last week I spent some time on rewriting my .vimrc from scratch and I made another &amp;ldquo;light-weight&amp;rdquo; version of .</description></item><item><title>Concurrency and Parallelelism</title><link>/2018/concurrency-and-parallelism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2018/concurrency-and-parallelism/</guid><description>We live in a universe where literally every system can multiprocess (Some claim that the universe itself is a parallel system but I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave that for another blog) but most of our programs are sequential. This is mainly because parallel systems are arduous to design.
Concurrent systems grow in complexity exponentially because the more concurrent the system gets, more the places it could fail. Handling for all the failable cases is what makes concurrent design laborious.</description></item><item><title>My day 1 of learning Kotlin</title><link>/2017/my-day-1-with-kotlin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2017 05:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2017/my-day-1-with-kotlin/</guid><description>I was reluctant to learn Android until now because of Java. With all the new languages out there, Java&amp;rsquo;s verbose nature and lack of syntactic sugar is not the most pleasing language to code in. Even though language alternatives like Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin exist for Android, I stuck with hybrid app development due to the lack of proper documentation for these alternatives.
A couple of days back, the Android team announced first-class support for kotlin and I started seeing a lot of Kotlin praise and tutorial coming up across the internet community.</description></item><item><title>Web Scraping 101 (part 2): Build an Anna University Result Scraper</title><link>/2017/web-scraping-101-part2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 02:51:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2017/web-scraping-101-part2/</guid><description>This is the follow-up to Web Scraping 101: Build a simple web scraper using PHP. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend you to read that before continuing.
In this tutorial, we will be building a simple web scraper that extracts the result from Anna University&amp;rsquo;s website. This tutorial is strictly for educational purposes.
AU Scraper We are going to do this in 4 simple steps:
Step 1: read the website and create the DOM Anna University provides a nice little endpoint using which we can view our result by sending a GET Request.</description></item><item><title>Web Scraping 101 : Build a simple web scraper using PHP</title><link>/2017/web-scraping-101/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 12:48:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2017/web-scraping-101/</guid><description>There are times when we want to extract data from a website. In most cases, you are provided with an API, but that&amp;rsquo;s not always plausible. So, when a website does not provide an API, the only way to get the data from the website is to scrape it off yourself.
In this tutorial, we are going to build a simple scraper using PHP to extract data from Wikipedia (I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend you to use Wikipedia API over this.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>/2016/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2016 13:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2016/hello-world/</guid><description>This is my first blog.
