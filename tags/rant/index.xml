It’s been over a year since I posted anything so I thought I should amuse you with a rant. So much has changed since I wrote my last blog. I moved out of my country and completed a master&amp;rsquo;s degree. Yup, I’m wiser now. I also survived a global pandemic using my life-long training of self-isolation. It feels like I was made for this very movement. Since you’re reading this, I assume you survived too.</description></item></channel></rss>
