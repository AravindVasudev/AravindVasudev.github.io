It’s been over a year since I posted anything so I thought I
should amuse you with a rant. So much has changed since I wrote my last blog. I
moved out of my country and completed a master&amp;rsquo;s degree. Yup, I’m wiser now. I
also survived a global pandemic using my life-long training of self-isolation.
It feels like I was made for this very movement. Since you’re reading this, I
assume you survived too. Congrats on staying alive! Vaccines are almost here,
and if what I read on all the conspiracy forums were legit, Bill Gates chan can
finally know how I feel. Hopefully, we will all get microchipped before the end
of this year and go back to regular life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
