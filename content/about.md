I'm Aravind, a software engineer who’s all about building cool distributed systems and geeking out over the latest tech. I’m currently working on backend systems at [Meta](https://www.facebook.com/), and before that, I tackled Chrome Infrastructure at [Google](https://www.google.com/). Oh, and I’m a Carnegie Mellon alum too!
