# Hi there!

I am Aravind Vasudevan, a software engineering graduate student at Carnegie
Mellon University School of Computer Science. I specialize in various aspects
of software engineering from architecting a software system, designing it to be
scalable, to building efficient DevOps pipelines. Before coming to CMU, I was a 
backend developer at Zoho CRM where worked on building tools and frameworks to
migrate to a microservice architecture.
