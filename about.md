# Hi there!

I am Aravind Vasudevan, a software engineering graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. I specialize in designing end-to-end distributed systems from engineering efficient architecture to building streamlined DevOps pipelines. 

Previously I worked as a full-time backend engineer for Zoho CRM, where I built frameworks to migrate a monolithic backend into microservices. I found roadblocks in our redesigning process and devised strategies to decouple the refactor into several steps split over releases.

Most recently, I interned with GoDaddy, where I worked on remodeling the analytics tool into several distributed processes. I rearchitected the tool to work with AWS Batch and reduced the overall execution time by two hours.

I am interested in developing scalable/distributed systems. Reach out to me: <a href="mailto:avasude2@andrew.cmu.edu">`avasude2@andrew.cmu.edu`</a>.
