I started writing this article around January 2022 but never got around
publishing it. Given its September already, I&rsquo;m going ahead and publishing the
draft. This is not intended to be read/shared but to just keep this blog going.
I have been playing wordle
continously for the past week with my colleagues. It&rsquo;s a simple game where you
guess a five letter word within six chances. At each guess, the game tells you
how many letters you got right, how many letters are in the word in a different
position, and how many aren&rsquo;t present in the answer. The game gives you a new
puzzle everyday. The game became so popular that even google added an easter
egg."><meta name=HandheldFriendly content="True"><meta name=MobileOptimized content="320"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.146.6"><meta name=robots content="index,follow"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta property="og:title" content="Solving Wordle"><meta property="og:description" content="

continously for the past week with my colleagues. It&rsquo;s a simple game where you
guess a five letter word within six chances. At each guess, the game tells you
how many letters you got right, how many letters are in the word in a different
position, and how many aren&rsquo;t present in the answer. The game gives you a new
puzzle everyday. The game became so popular that even google added an easter
egg.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/google_wordle_easter_egg.gif alt="Google Wordle Easter Egg"></p><p>As I started getting into the game, I thought to myself, would it be cheating
if I looked up for words in a dictionary? I felt given english was my second
language, I was already in a minor disadvantage so until I don&rsquo;t explicitly
lookup the solution, what&rsquo;s the big deal, right? I then thought if I am going
to simple look upto a dictionary and use each guess to eliminate words, why
not write a script to do it? After all, the script would be literally doing
what I would do right? Right now, I didn&rsquo;t know where it stops being fair and
where it starts to become cheating but write a simple solver for the game
sounded like a fun weekend project.</p><p>Initially, I started breaking down the game into its logical components. The
game only allows legitimate words as its guesses which means, &ldquo;aeiou&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a
valid guess. Futhermore, looking into the game&rsquo;s source code, the front end
comes bundled with two lists of possible words. The combines to 12972 words.
With some further research, I figured the game only uses the first list, which
contains all the most common words, which even brings down the total search
space to 2315 words.</p><p>Even with 2315 words, with random guessing, I still only got 6/2315 chances. You
don&rsquo;t have to be an expert in math to know that a very slim chance. So, to
further reduce my search space, I implemented the game&rsquo;s rules into a pruning
function. Each time when a word is guessed, the rule engine builds a set of all
correct, partial, and wrong guesses. It then goes through the list and prunes
it. This was much efficient than I thought.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/wordle_solver_1.png alt="Wordle Solver: First Attempt"></p><p>Well, a simple algorithm to prune the possible set of words did the job.
However, taking so many tries to solve the puzzle is still inefficient. Taking
a deep look into it, the major issue I found was when there is more than one
possbile word that can be used for the current guess, the algorithm simply
selects the first option. When I solve it, I usually use words like &ldquo;adieu&rdquo; as
my starters as they can elimate a ton of words by figuring out which vowels to
use. &ldquo;adieu&rdquo; does not exist in the list but just simple adding it as the first
guess significantly improves the search attempts.</p><p>The reason &ldquo;adieu&rdquo; did better was because it had 4 out of 5 vowels in the
english language. Almost all of the words in my dataset had vowels in them.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/wordle_vowel_stats.png alt="Wordle Vowel Stats"></p><p>I wrote a simple script to generate word count for each vowel and consonant
and a histogram to visually represent it.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/wordle_consonant_stats.png alt="Wordle Consonant Stats"></p><p>I came with a simple heuristic: Almost all words have vowels in them and given
consonants have their distribution too, if I could come up with a heuristic
weight for each of the word and sort them using that, each guess would elimate
the as many words as possible. With this idea, I wrote a simple function to
order each letter based on its occurence and generated a weight for each word
using the sum of the letter order. This way, the heaviest must have the most
used letters.</p><p><img src=/images/blog/wordle_attempt_two.png alt="Wordle Solver: Second Attempt"></p><p>This improve search time by miles but without actually quantifying it, it is
simply an ancedotal data. A simple script to generate number of guesses for all
words shows there are two words that require ten guesses and in total 148 words
that require over 6 attempts. So, the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t always win. This can be
probably improved by using a relative heuristic where the words are not only
sorted by the occurence order of each letter but also the relative distance
between the letters. As in, if x has 10 occurence and then next most y has 100,
the heuristic weight should reflect the distance. However, I want to stop here
and maybe leave that as a homework for you :p. adieu!</p><p>Source: <a href=https://github.com/AravindVasudev/wordle-bot>AravindVasudev/wordle-bot</a></p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
