# Hi there!

I'm a programming enthusiast pursuing Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering.  

I spend my free time mostly programming or reading about the same. So Basically,

```
MaLife = Eat + Sleep + Code
```

My choice of tools is Javascript, Python, and PHP.

As of now, I can do Full Stack Development using MEN Stack (Mongo Express Node)
and the infamous LAMP Stack (with some Laravel) and I'm exploring other
corners of Computer Science.

You can check out some of my projects here: [GITHUB](https://github.com/AravindVasudev)
